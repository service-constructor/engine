# Service Constructor

Open-source platform for embedding mini-apps and a payment saga into any
fintech wallet that handles money. Based on the
[Service Constructor white paper](./Service_Constructor_Whitepaper.pdf).

A registered **service** is an autonomous web app the wallet embeds via a
WebView; settlement runs through an orchestrator that freezes funds, executes
the service, and captures payment under a transactional saga.

This repository implements the **Service Registry** (CRUD over services) and the
**payment saga** (`POST /v1/services/pay`): a signed-quote + device-signed
consent flow that runs `freeze → execute → capture/release` under an explicit
order state machine. Both are exposed as gRPC with an HTTP/JSON gateway.

## Architecture

```
HTTP/JSON  ──►  grpc-gateway  ──►  gRPC server  ──►  Registry use case  ──►  Postgres
  (:8080)        (reverse proxy)     (:9090)          (validation, ids)        (pgx)
```

Layers (clean separation, transport- and storage-agnostic core):

| Path                              | Role                                              |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `proto/`                          | gRPC + HTTP contract (source of truth)            |
| `gen/`                            | Generated stubs (`buf generate`)                  |
| `internal/domain`                 | Core entities and invariants (service, order, state machine) |
| `internal/service`               | Registry use case, `Repository` port              |
| `internal/saga`                   | Payment orchestrator, quote/consent verification, `Ledger`/`Executor` ports (+ mocks) |
| `internal/auth`                   | Pluggable `Authenticator`, gRPC interceptor       |
| `internal/repository/postgres`    | Postgres adapters (services, orders), migrations runner |
| `internal/server`                 | gRPC adapters, proto↔domain mapping               |
| `cmd/server`                      | Wiring: migrations, gRPC, gateway, shutdown       |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Start Postgres
make docker-up

# 2. Run the API (applies migrations on startup)
AUTH_MODE=none make run        # dev: no auth; or AUTH_JWT_SECRET=... make run

# 3. Run the admin UI (separate terminal)
cd admin-ui && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

Defaults (override via env): `GRPC_ADDR=:9090`, `HTTP_ADDR=:8080`,
`DATABASE_URL=postgres://sc:sc@localhost:5432/service_constructor?sslmode=disable`,
`AUTH_MODE=jwt` (requires `AUTH_JWT_SECRET`).

## Authentication (pluggable)

Auth is a replaceable boundary on **both** ends so an integrator can wire in
their existing identity system without forking the app:

- **Backend** — implement `auth.Authenticator` (`internal/auth`) and pass it to
  the gRPC interceptor. Built-ins: `jwt` (HMAC JWT, reads `Authorization:
  Bearer`) and `none` (dev only, accepts everything). Selected via `AUTH_MODE`;
  swap `buildAuthenticator` in `cmd/server/main.go` for a custom one.
- **Frontend** — implement the `TokenProvider` interface
  (`admin-ui/src/auth/types.ts`) and change the one export in
  `admin-ui/src/auth/index.ts`. The default keeps a token in localStorage; swap
  it to source the token from an SSO cookie, OAuth flow, etc.

The admin API requires the `admin` role; the interceptor returns `401` when
unauthenticated and `403` without the role.

**Ownership (multi-tenant).** Each service is owned by the account that created
it (`owner_id` = the token `sub`). A regular `admin` only sees and edits their
own services; the `super_admin` role sees and edits all of them. Scoping is
enforced in both the use-case layer and the SQL (defense in depth), so a
cross-owner read/update/delete returns `404`.

## Admin UI

`admin-ui/` is a React + Vite + TypeScript SPA: list, create, edit and delete
services, plus generate/rotate service keys. Key generation runs on the backend
(Ed25519 or EC P-256); the **private key PEM is returned once** and never stored
— the UI shows a copy/download dialog. In dev, Vite proxies `/v1` to the gateway
on `:8080`; in prod, co-host the built `dist/` behind the API or set
`VITE_API_BASE`.

## REST API (via gateway)

| Method & path                          | Purpose          |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| `POST   /v1/admin/services`               | Create a service          |
| `GET    /v1/admin/services/{id}`          | Get a service             |
| `GET    /v1/admin/services`               | List (paginated)          |
| `PATCH  /v1/admin/services/{id}`          | Partial update            |
| `DELETE /v1/admin/services/{id}`          | Delete                    |
| `POST   /v1/admin/services/{id}/keys`     | Generate a key pair       |
| `POST   /v1/admin/services/{id}/rotate-key` | Rotate (new key + retire) |

List supports `pageSize`, `pageToken` (keyset cursor) and `status` filter.
`PATCH` uses field-mask semantics: only fields present in the JSON body change.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/admin/services -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "name": "eSIM Provider",
  "origins": ["https://esim.example.com"],
  "executeUrl": "https://esim.example.com/execute",
  "statusUrl": "https://esim.example.com/status",
  "receivingWallets": [{"currencyId": "1", "walletId": "wlt_usdt_01"}],
  "fee": {"percent": "1.5"},
  "status": "SERVICE_STATUS_ACTIVE"
}'
```

## Payment saga

`POST /v1/services/pay` runs the saga over a **signed quote** + **device-signed
consent** (white paper section 7). The platform never lets a service debit funds
on its own: the service signs the quote with its private key (verified against
the registry public key by `kid`), and the user approves it on a trusted screen,
producing a device signature over `hash(quote) + wallet + nonce`.

Order state machine (white paper section 8):

```
CREATED → FROZEN → EXECUTING → EXECUTED → COMPLETED      (happy path)
                       ↓ PENDING (async, awaits webhook)
                       ↓ FAILED → RELEASED                (compensation)
```

Invariant: funds are moved to **held** (Ledger.freeze) *before* execute, so a
confirmed service is guaranteed to settle. On failure the held amount is
**released** back. The handler is **idempotent on the quote nonce**.

The `Ledger` (freeze/capture/release) and `Executor` (provider executeUrl) are
**ports**. The Ledger ships as an in-memory mock; the Executor has a real HTTP
implementation (`EXECUTOR_MODE=http`) that POSTs to each service's `executeUrl`
with a timeout, bounded idempotent retries (backoff), and a per-service circuit
breaker — and a mock for local runs (`EXECUTOR_MODE=mock`, the default). A
`DeviceKeyResolver` supplies device public keys (static for local runs).

See [`example-service`](../example-service) for a runnable reference service the
HTTP executor calls end-to-end.

| Method & path                                  | Purpose                       |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `POST /v1/services/pay`                        | Run the saga (auth: user)     |
| `GET  /v1/services/{serviceId}/orders/{orderId}` | Order state                 |
| `POST /v1/services/callback`                   | Provider webhook (auth: signature) |

**Async execution.** A slow provider returns `PENDING`; the order parks until
the provider posts a signed callback to `/v1/services/callback` (verified
against the service key, idempotent by orderId): `SUCCESS` captures, `FAILED`
releases. A background **reconciler** scans orders stuck past their freeze TTL
and finalizes them — but before any release it queries the service's `statusUrl`
(**query-before-compensate**, white paper section 11.2): `DONE` captures,
`NOT_DONE` releases, `UNKNOWN` is left untouched, so a lost response never
triggers a blind refund of a delivered service.

## Development

```bash
make tools      # install protoc-gen-go, -go-grpc, -grpc-gateway
make generate   # regenerate gen/ from proto/
make test       # run unit tests
make build      # build ./bin/server
```

Code generation uses [buf](https://buf.build) with googleapis annotation protos
vendored under `third_party/` (no Buf Schema Registry auth required).
